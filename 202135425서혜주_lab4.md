I/O Redirection: Standard Output
You can redirect output using “>” after a command (e.g., ls) to create and save the 
output in a file

### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko)
or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source softwares.

### Dependencies (Level 3 Heading)
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manager
### Installation
In a bash terminal, run the following commands *(Do NOT actually run these commands in
your computer):*
```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
```
